        <h1>Services</h1>
        <h2 id="all-services">All Services</h2><p>I offer a range of healing modalities to support your journey toward wholeness, aliveness, and connection.</p>
<h3 id="body-based-distance-healing">Body-Based Distance Healing</h3><p>According to Ortho-Bionomy®, everything in the universe has a self-righting reflex. During a session we may engage your reflexes to release pain and feel more comfort in your body, or see what shifts when you bring new awareness to posture, play, and body mechanics. Sometimes the body just needs gentle witness and validation to complete its own processes. Because matter and energy are connected, this work can be done just as easily at a distance as in person.</p>
<h3 id="spirit-communication">Spirit Communication</h3><p>Sessions we do with your guides are equally physical in nature. While the work may sound abstract or fanciful, it integrates tangibly in all aspects of your being. Connecting with multiple realms is not separate from our lives and our physical reality—this communication affects our bodies and our experiences.</p>
<h3 id="animal-communication">Animal Communication</h3><p>Connecting with the wisdom and perspective of our animal companions to support healing, understanding, and deepened relationship.</p>
<h3 id="ortho-bionomy-r">Ortho-Bionomy®</h3><p>A gentle, non-invasive system of healing that honors the body's innate wisdom and self-correcting reflexes. Ortho-Bionomy® uses comfortable positioning and gentle movements to help the body release tension and pain.</p>
<h3 id="cranial-sacral-therapy">Cranial Sacral Therapy</h3><p>A gentle hands-on technique that releases tensions deep in the body to relieve pain and dysfunction and improve whole-body health and performance.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-freedom-technique-eft">Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)</h3><p>A psychological acupressure technique that supports emotional healing by tapping on specific meridian points while focusing on specific issues.</p>
<h3 id="therapeutic-bodywork">Therapeutic Bodywork</h3><p>Integrative bodywork that honors the connection between body, mind, and spirit, supporting deep relaxation and healing.</p>
<h3 id="flower-essences">Flower Essences</h3><p>Vibrational remedies made from flowers that address emotional and spiritual imbalances, supporting transformation and growth.</p>
<h3 id="working-with-death-and-dying">Working with Death and Dying</h3><p>Compassionate support for those navigating end-of-life transitions, grief, and the sacred process of dying. Honoring the journey with presence and care.</p>
